# teams-auto-degrade
A small script to automatically degrade a participant of a teams meeting with a hotkey

## How to Use
Run the .py or .exe file of the latest release. If you then hover over a participant
of a teams meeting and press f8 it will be automatically degraded. If you are not using teams
in fullscreen on a 1080p monitor you first need to update the position of the confirmation box by
hovering over the confirmation button and pressing shift + f8. The program can be killed by
pressing F7.
